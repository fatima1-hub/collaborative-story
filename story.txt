A short story about friendship between two girls

Maya and Noor met in kindergarten over a shared love for glitter glue.
They painted each other’s hands more than their art projects.
From playground games to sleepovers, they did everything together.
They made a secret handshake only they could remember.
In middle school, they started a silly podcast no one listened to—except each other.
When Noor’s parents divorced, Maya was there every single day.
And when Maya failed her first math test, Noor helped her study with snacks and hugs.
They dreamed of traveling the world, making lists of places they’d go.
High school brought crushes, drama, and new people—but never distance between them.
Even when they argued, their apologies came with playlists and doodles.
They graduated side by side, shouting each other's names across the stage.
College sent them to different cities, but their chats never stopped.
One summer, they finally took that trip—backpacks, journals, and all.
On a quiet beach, they laughed until they cried, just like old times.
Some friendships are built. Theirs? Unbreakable from the start.
